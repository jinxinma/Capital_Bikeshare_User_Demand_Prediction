# Capital Bikeshare User Demand Prediction

### Repository Structure
I have included the following files in this repository:

`Jinxin_RealSelf_Data_Challenge.ipynb`: This jupyter notebook presents a end-to-end machine learning project. The goal is to predict the user demand of Capital Bikeshare given temporal and weather information. To run the notebook, please make sure you have Scikit-learn, Pandas, numpy, and XGBoost installed.

`Jinxin_RealSelf_Data_Challenge.html`: The HTML is essentially the same as the notebook, it serves as a presentation of my work.

`bikeshare_shiny.R`: This Shiny app draws an interactive heatmap of average user count grouped by weekday and hour. The app serves as my answer to the visualization question.

`hourly_users_data.csv`: Raw data.
